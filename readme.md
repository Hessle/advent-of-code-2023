# My solutions for the advent of code 2023 

to run the code in this project, either:

1. install yarn on your machine. on mac you can use `brew install yarn`. On windows consider installing chocolatey and then run `choco install yarn`
2. in the root of the project run `yarn`

or:
1. install node on your machine directly (eg. using brew on MacOs or chocolatey on Windows)

Afterwards you can run js-files with the command from the directory they are in: `node <file-name>.js`
